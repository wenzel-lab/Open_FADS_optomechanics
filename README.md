# Open Soure Hardware Optics and Mechanics Design for Fluorescence Activated (Microfluidic) Droplet Sorting (FADS)

It in cludes the design of positioning, lasers, filters, detectors, fixtures for open droplet sorting.

## Contribution guide

This is an open collaborative project currently lead by Tobias Wenze in the Wenzel Lab in Santiago, Chile; your participation (comments, inputs, contributions, issues) are explicitly welcome!

Please get involved by extending the project or interacting with us by submitting an issue, contact us (e.g. [here](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/people/faculty/821-tobias-wenzel)). Particular extensions wanted are: Simplify the pyprl library fork to the needed tools in this context; further development of the GUI for the user/experimentor and to change the sorting parameters; collecting custom droplet sorting challenges not currently well addressed by exsisting literature examples; extension to more-dimensional questions (boards with more fast analougue inputs-outputs, sorting based on spectral analysis with detector array, sorting based on 2D detector arrays such as imaging detectors, sorting with additional sensor to verify positive sorting events, etc.).
